Chapter 1. Environment Variables
================================

A lot of tests need configuration.  This is information that is required by
tests but typically cannot be hard coded.  Typically, this configuration is
a package repository needed for testing an installation method.  It is up to
the user running the tests to do whatever local setup is required and set
these configuration parameters.

Configuration parameters come from the environment.  All environment variables
starting with KSTEST_ will be grabbed by run_kickstart_tests.sh and
automatically substituted in to the kickstart file before it is run.  In the
kickstart file, the target of a substitution is any string starting with
@KSTEST_ and ending with another @.  This is similar to how the autotools work.

Configuration parameters may also come from special shell scripts that are
sourced during run_kickstart_tests.sh.  It will first look at the defaults in
scripts/defaults.sh.  It will then look at any user-specific defaults in
~/.kstests.defaults.sh.  These take precedence over the local environment.
Environment variables set on the command line have the highest priority.

Note that not every test needs every setting.  You can determine which are
required for the test you are running by simply running "grep KSTEST_" on it.

The following environment variables are currently supported:

- KSTEST_HTTP_ADDON_REPO - This variable is a URL that points to an addon
  repository.  It is only needed if you are testing that functionality, not
  if you are testing something else that just happens to use the url command.
  It will be set up for you automatically with a web server and auto-generated
  packages.  There is no need to specify this variable.

- KSTEST_LIVEIMG_CHECKSUM - This variable is the checksum of the image given
  by KSTEST_LIVEIMG_URL.  It is only needed if you are testing the liveimg
  command.  It will be set up for you automatically.  There is no need to
  specify this variable.

- KSTEST_LIVEIMG_URL - This variable is a URL that points to an install.img
  that is used by the liveimg command.  It is only needed if you are testing
  that command.  It will be set up for you automatically based on the boot.iso
  specified on the command line.  There is no need to specify this variable.

- KSTEST_NFS_ADDON_REPO - This variable points to an NFS server and path where
  an addon repository can be found. It is only needed if you are testing that
  functionality. If not specified it will be set up for you automatically with
  an NFS export and auto-generated packages. It is different from KSTEST_NFS_PATH
  and KSTEST_NFS_SERVER.  Those are used with the nfs command.  This variable
  is used with the repo command, and its format is different.  Here, it takes
  the form of nfs://<server>:<path>.  See the kickstart documentation.  You
  will need to set up your own NFS server.

- KSTEST_NFS_PATH - This variable points to the path of a package repository
  on the NFS server given by KSTEST_NFS_SERVER.  It is only needed if you are
  testing the nfs command and installation method.  You will need to set up
  your own NFS server.

- KSTEST_NFS_SERVER - This variable points at an NFS server, and is only needed
  if you are testing the nfs command and installation method.  You will need to
  set up your own NFS server.

- KSTEST_OSTREE_REPO - This variable points at the atomic repo, and is only
  needed if you are testing the ostreesetup command and installation method.
  You will need to set up your own repo.

- KSTEST_FTP_URL - This variable is used by FTP tests. It is set to a Fedora
  mirror in Texas, USA in scripts/defaults.sh. This is potentially slow and
  you may want to point it at a local mirror.

- KSTEST_URL - This variable is used by all tests that don't test installation
  method and instead just use the default.  It is set to the Fedora mirrors in
  scripts/defaults.sh.  This is potentially slow if you are running a lot of
  tests, and you may want to point it at a local mirror.

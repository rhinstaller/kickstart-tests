# Start/stop a transparent squid proxy in a container. System podman containers will
# automatically use this to route plain http traffic through the cache, and thus
# greatly speed up the kickstart tests.

# This does NOT work with user podman containers, as they don't use a bridge, but slirp.
# Transparent content caching does NOT work with https in principle.
#
# Call this with "clean" to  drop the persistent squid cache.

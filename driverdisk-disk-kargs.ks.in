# Module version folder is created by the RPM with driver disk. The RPM is
# created by the script in lib/mkdud.py. The kernel version is 3.0.0 if
# version parameter is not explicitly set. Because the tests are run on a
# boot.iso, we don't know which kernel version is there in time of the script
# execution.
# TODO: This can be improved by grabbing logs from Lorax when building this iso
# or by running the boot.iso in some pre-testing phase.

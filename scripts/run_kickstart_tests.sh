# This script runs the entire kickstart_tests suite.  It is an interface
# between "make check" (which is why it takes environment variables instead
# of arguments) and livemedia-creator.  Each test consists of a kickstart
# file that specifies most everything about the installation, and a shell
# script that does validation and specifies kernel boot parameters.  lmc
# then fires up a VM and watches for tracebacks or stuck installs.
#
# A boot ISO is required, which should be specified with TEST_BOOT_ISO=.
#
# The number of jobs corresponds to the number of VMs that will be started
# simultaneously.  Each one wants about 1 GB of memory.  The default is
# four simultaneous jobs, but you can control this with TEST_JOBS=.  It is
# suggested you not run out of memory.
#
# You can control what logs are held onto after the test is complete via the
# KEEPIT= variable, explained below.  By default, nothing is kept.
#
# Finally, you can run tests across multiple computers at the same time by
# putting all the hostnames into TEST_REMOTES= as a space separated list.
# Do not add localhost manually, as it will always be added for you.  You
# must create a user named kstest on each remote system, and have ssh keys
# set up so that the user running this script can login to the remote systems
# as kstest without a password.  TEST_JOBS= applies on a per-system basis.
# KEEPIT= controls how much will be kept on the master system (where "make
# check" is run).  All results will be removed from the slave systems.

# The boot.iso location can come from one of two different places:
# (1) $TEST_BOOT_ISO, if this script is being called from "make check"
# (2) The command line, if this script is being called directly.  That will
#     be checked below.

# Possible values for this parameter:
# 0 - Keep nothing (the default)
# 1 - Keep log files
# 2 - Keep log files and disk images (will take up a lot of space)

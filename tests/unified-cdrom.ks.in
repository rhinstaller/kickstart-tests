# This test is for testing the install from an unified repository.
#
# You have to have unified ISO as a source mounted on the HTTP server.
# To create unified ISO for Fedora you can use this tool:
# https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/tree/main/modify_install_iso
#

#
# This installation has to be booted by the unified ISO instead of boot ISO.

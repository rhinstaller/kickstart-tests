# This test is for testing the install from an unified repository.
#
# You have to have unified ISO as a source mounted on the NFS server.
# To create unified ISO for Fedora you can use this tool:
# https://github.com/rhinstaller/devel-tools/tree/main/modify_install_iso
#
# This test has to have access to the NFS server. However NFS won't mount
# if the VM is behind a NAT (NFS problem). So this test won't work on our setup
# right now.
